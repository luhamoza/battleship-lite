Battleship Lite Console Application
===================================

Introduction
------------

This console application is a simplified version of the classic Battleship game, implemented in C# using the .NET Framework 4.7.2. The game allows two players to take turns firing shots at each other's grid to sink their opponent's ships.

Usage
-----

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the solution file (`BattleshipLite.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3.  Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4.  Run the application (`ConsoleUI` project) to start playing Battleship Lite.

Gameplay
--------

*   Players take turns firing shots at their opponent's grid.
*   Each player has a grid where they place their ships.
*   The application prompts players to input their shots by providing grid coordinates (e.g., A1, B2).
*   The game displays the results of each shot as hits, misses, or sunk ships.
*   The game continues until one player sinks all of their opponent's ships.
